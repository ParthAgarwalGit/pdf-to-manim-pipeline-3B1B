# Product Overview

## PDF to Manim Animation Pipeline

An agent-orchestrated system that transforms academic PDF documents into 3Blue1Brown-style animated educational videos. The pipeline converts static academic content (text, equations, diagrams, proofs) into executable Manim animation code with accompanying narration scripts.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Animation**: Converts PDFs to executable Python/Manim code without manual coding
- **Pedagogical Focus**: Emphasizes visual intuition and conceptual continuity over textual density
- **3Blue1Brown Style**: Animated mathematical objects, minimal on-screen text, visual transformations
- **Scene-Based Output**: Atomic animation units with narration, visual intent, and timing

### Target Users

Content creators and educators who want to transform academic papers, textbooks, or lecture notes into engaging animated explanations without learning Manim programming.

### Key Outputs

- Executable Manim animation code (Python files per scene)
- Narration scripts synchronized with visual timing
- Structured storyboards (JSON) with scene specifications
- Deterministic, reproducible results for identical inputs
